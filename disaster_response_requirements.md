# Disaster Response UAS Requirements

## Operational Requirements

### Coverage Area
- **Area Size**: Ability to survey 5-10 square kilometers within 2 hours
- **Grid Pattern**: Capability to fly in precise grid patterns for systematic coverage
- **Repeat Coverage**: Ability to revisit the same area multiple times per day to track changes

### Environmental Conditions
- **Wind Tolerance**: Must operate in winds up to 25 knots
- **Precipitation**: Should function in light to moderate rainfall
- **Temperature Range**: Operational in temperatures from -10°C to +45°C
- **Dust/Smoke**: Ability to operate in environments with reduced visibility due to dust, smoke, or ash

### Response Time
- **Deployment**: Ready for flight within 15 minutes of arrival on scene
- **Operational Availability**: 24/7 capability with minimal maintenance between flights
- **Mission Duration**: Minimum 3 hours continuous operation without refueling/battery change

## Technical Requirements

### Flight Performance
- **Range**: Minimum 50 km operational radius from ground control station
- **Endurance**: Minimum 3 hours flight time; 6+ hours preferred
- **Altitude**: Variable operational altitude from 100-3000 meters AGL
- **Speed**: Variable speed capability, including slow flight (hover for multirotors) for detailed inspection

### Payload Requirements
- **Capacity**: Minimum 2 kg payload capacity
- **Power Supply**: Provide power and data interfaces for various sensor packages
- **Quick Change**: Ability to swap payload packages in under 10 minutes

### Sensor Package
- **Imaging**: High-resolution visible light camera with zoom capability
- **Thermal Imaging**: IR camera with heat detection and visualization
- **Multispectral**: Optional multispectral imaging for specific applications
- **Stabilization**: 3-axis gimbal for stable imagery during flight

### Data Handling
- **Transmission**: Real-time data transmission to ground station
- **Range**: Minimum 50 km line-of-sight data link
- **Encryption**: Secure, encrypted data transmission
- **Recording**: Onboard data storage as backup to transmitted data
- **Processing**: Basic onboard processing capabilities for image enhancement or AI detection

## Operational Constraints

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Certification**: Must meet FAA/EASA UAV certification requirements
- **Remote ID**: Equipped with remote identification technology
- **Airspace Integration**: Capability for integration with air traffic management systems

### Usability
- **Training**: Operator training requirement not to exceed 40 hours
- **Crew Requirements**: Maximum of 2 personnel to deploy and operate
- **Interface**: Intuitive control system with minimal training requirements

### Logistics
- **Transport**: System must be transportable in a standard pickup truck or SUV
- **Setup Time**: Field setup and deployment in less than 15 minutes
- **Power Requirements**: Operate on standard generators or vehicle power systems
- **Field Maintenance**: Basic maintenance possible in field conditions

### Cost Considerations
- **Acquisition Cost**: Below $2M for complete system including ground control
- **Operational Cost**: Below $500 per flight hour
- **Maintenance Cost**: Annual maintenance below 15% of acquisition cost

## Stakeholder Requirements

### Emergency Response Teams
- Clear, actionable intelligence delivered in real-time
- Simple interpretation of data (minimal specialized training)
- Ruggedized system that can withstand field conditions
- Minimal logistical footprint (easy to transport, set up, operate)

### Technical Experts
- Data quality sufficient for technical analysis
- Raw data access for post-mission detailed analysis
- Integration capability with existing data systems
- Programmable flight paths for consistent data collection

### Procurement Officers
- Competitive lifecycle costs
- Reliability metrics (MTBF, availability)
- Support package and warranty terms
- Upgrade path for future capabilities

### Regulatory Authorities
- Compliance with all applicable regulations
- Safety features including return-to-home, geo-fencing
- Collision avoidance systems
- Flight logging for post-incident investigation
